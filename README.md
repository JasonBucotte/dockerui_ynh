----------------------------------------
Warning: This YunoHost app is still in development. Use it at your own risk!

This YunoHost application installs Docker along with the DockerUI web interface

## DockerUI

![Containers](https://github.com/crosbymichael/dockerui/blob/master/container.png?raw=true)
DockerUI is a web interface for the Docker Remote API.  The goal is to provide a pure client side implementation so it is effortless to connect and manage docker.  This project is not complete and is still under heavy development.

### Goals
* Minimal dependencies - I really want to keep this project a pure html/js app.
* Consistency - The web UI should be consistent with the commands found on the docker CLI.

### License - MIT
The DockerUI code is licensed under the MIT license.
